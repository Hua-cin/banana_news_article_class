A performance artist who ate a banana taped to a wall that was an artwork valued at $120,000 said his actions were not vandalism and he does not regret his snack at Art Basel in Miami Beach, Florida.
一名吃掉一根以膠帶貼在牆上之價值12萬美元香蕉藝術品的行為藝術家說，他的行為並非糟蹋作品，而且他對在佛羅里達州邁阿密海灘市舉行的「巴塞爾藝術展」吃起點心不感愧疚。
Artist Maurizio Cattelan’s piece - a banana duct-taped to a wall and called "Comedian" - sold for $120,000.
藝術家莫瑞吉奧‧卡特蘭之作──一根香蕉以強力膠帶貼在牆上，名為「喜劇演員」──以12萬美元賣出。
Performance artist David Datuna joined the crowd taking selfies with the banana on Saturday and then pulled off the tape and ate the banana in a video widely shared on social media.
在一支社群媒體廣為流傳的影片中，行為藝術家戴維‧達圖納週六擠入和這根香蕉自拍的人潮，接著撕下膠帶並把香蕉吃了。
"First of all, I very respect this artist. For me, he is one of the top artists in the world," Datuna said. "And I think this is the first one in art history when one artist eat concept of another artist. People ask me, you eat banana? Physically it was banana, but banana is just a tool. So I eat the concept of the art."
「首先，我很尊敬這名藝術家。對我而言，他是世界頂尖藝術家之一」，達圖納說。「然後我想，這是藝術史上一名藝術家吃掉另一名藝術家概念的頭一遭。民眾問我，你吃了香蕉？形體上，它是香蕉，但香蕉只是一個工具。所以我吃的是藝術的概念。」
He added that the artwork tasted good.
他補充說，這件藝術品吃起來味道很好。
"So it’s not like, again, vandalism. It was art performance from me. And absolutely, I’m not sorry," he said. "I call performance ’Hungry Artist’. Yeah, because I was hungry and I just eat it." (Reuters)
「所以，再次重申，這不像是糟蹋作品。這是我的行為藝術。而且我絕不感愧疚」，他說。「我以『飢餓的藝術家』稱此表演。是的，因為我餓了，所以我就吃了它。」（路透）
